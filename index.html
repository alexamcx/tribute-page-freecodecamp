    <h3>Time line of Oscar Wilde's life:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1854:</strong> Born in Dublin, Ireland</li>

      <li><strong>1864:</strong> Joined his brother Willie at Portora Royal School in Enniskillen</li>

      <li><strong>1871:</strong> Left Portora with a royal scholarship to read classics at Trinity College Dublin</li>

      <li><strong>1874:</strong> At Oxford University Magdalen College, he read Greats from 1874 to 1878, Wilde became particularly well known for his role in the aesthetic and decadent movements</li>

      <li><strong>1878:</strong> Wilde won the 1878 Newdigate Prize for his poem "Ravenna". In November, he graduated with a double first in his B.A. of Classical Moderations and Literae Humaniores (Greats).</li>

      <li><strong>1881:</strong> at 27 years old, he published Poems, which collected, revised, and expanded his poems.</li>

      <li><strong>1882:</strong> Richard D'Oyly Carte, an English impresario, invited Wilde to make a lecture tour of North America, simultaneously priming the pump for the US tour of Patience and selling this most charming aesthete to the American public.<br> Carolyn Burdett writes, <em>"Wilde teased his readers with the claim that life imitates art rather than the other way round. His point was a serious one: we notice London fogs, he argued, because art and literature has taught us to do so"</em></li>

      <li><strong>1883:</strong> His earnings, plus expected income from The Duchess of Padua, allowed him to move to Paris</li>

      <li><strong>1884:</strong> Married Constance Lloyd at the Anglican St James's Church, Paddington, in London</li>

      <li><strong>1886:</strong> at Oxford, Wilde met Robert Ross. Ross, who had read Wilde's poems before they met, seemed unrestrained by the Victorian prohibition against homosexuality. By Richard Ellmann's account, he was a precocious seventeen-year-old who <em>"so young and yet so knowing, was determined to seduce Wilde"</em></li>

      <li><strong>1887:</strong> Wilde became the editor of The Lady's World magazine, his name prominently appearing on the cover. He promptly renamed it as The Woman's World and raised its tone, adding serious articles on parenting, culture, and politics, while keeping discussions of fashion and arts</li>

      <li><strong>1889:</strong> Published <em>"The Portrait of Mr. W. H."</em>. It is a short story, which reports a conversation, in which the theory that Shakespeare's sonnets were written out of the poet's love of the boy actor "Willie Hughes", is advanced, retracted, and then propounded again. The only evidence for this is two supposed puns within the sonnets themselves.</li>

      <li><strong>1890:</strong> The first version of The Picture of Dorian Gray was published as the lead story in the July 1890 edition of Lippincott's Monthly Magazine. Reviewers immediately criticised the novel's decadence and homosexual allusions</li>

      <li><strong>1891:</strong> He revised The Picture of Dorian Gray extensively for book publication: 6 new chapters were added, some overtly decadent passages and homo-eroticism excised, and a preface was included consisting of 22 epigrams, such as <em>"Books are well written, or badly written. That is all."</em></li>

      <li><strong>1892:</strong> Wilde, who had first set out to irritate Victorian society with his dress and talking points, then outrage it with Dorian Gray, his novel of vice hidden beneath art, finally found a way to critique society on its own terms. Lady Windermere's Fan was first performed on 20 February 1892 at St James's Theatre, packed with the cream of society</li>

      <li><strong>1893:</strong> An intimate friendship sprang up between Wilde and Lord Alfred Douglas and they consorted together regularly in a tempestuous affair.</li>

      <li><strong>February 1895:</strong> Wilde's final play, The Importance of Being Earnest, again returns to the theme of switched identities: the play's two protagonists engage in "bunburying" (the maintenance of alternative personas in the town and country) which allows them to escape Victorian social mores.</li>

      <li><strong>April 1895:</strong> Wilde prosecuted the Marquess of Queensberry for criminal libel. The Marquess was the father of Wilde's lover, Lord Alfred Douglas. The libel trial unearthed evidence that caused Wilde to drop his charges and led to his own arrest and trial for gross indecency with men. Wilde was incarcerated from 25 May 1895 to 18 May 1897</li>

      <li><strong>1897:</strong> Although Douglas had been the cause of his misfortunes, he and Wilde were reunited in August at Rouen, France. During the latter part of the year, Wilde and Douglas lived together near Naples for a few months until they were separated by their families under the threat of cutting off all funds</li>

      <li><strong>1898:</strong> He wrote his last work, The Ballad of Reading Gaol, a long poem commemorating the harsh rhythms of prison life</li>

      <li><strong>1900:</strong> Wilde died of meningitis aged 46 in Paris, France</li>
